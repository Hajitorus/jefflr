# mixlr-toolkit-bookmarklet

Just a silly little tool to make your [Mixlr](http://www.mixlr.com/) (read: [#jefflr](http://mixlr.com/jeff-gerstmann/chat)) experience even better!

___

## Why?

+ Makes the theme a lot darker (blue-ish gray/orange color scheme)
+ Adds a Message Limiting function (defaults to 200)
+ Adds an Autoheart function (sorry, Mixlr devs!)

+ It's kinda neat

___

## Usage

+ Click that bookmark when you're on a Mixlr chat page
+ Enjoy!
